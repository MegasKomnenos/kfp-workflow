# Project Structure

This file is the maintained directory map for the root project. It is intentionally concise and focuses on the directories and files that a maintainer or operator is expected to use.

## Documentation Inventory

- `README.md`: entry point for the integrated root project
- `DOCS.md`: repo-specific documentation rules and audit lessons
- `CLI_COMMAND_TREE.md`: canonical public `kfp-workflow` command hierarchy
- `OPERATIONS.md`: repeatable procedures, command patterns, and deployment notes
- `examples/README.md`: tutorial navigation in Korean
- `models/*/README.md`: package-local overviews and current integration status
- `models/*/PROJECT.md`: package-local tree summaries
- `models/*/OPERATIONS.md`: package-local workflow guidance where maintained

## Runtime and Code Boundaries

- Root code under `src/kfp_workflow/` is the orchestration layer.
- Model packages under `models/` own model-specific training logic, search spaces, and some package-local Kubeflow helpers.
- Only the plugins explicitly registered in `src/kfp_workflow/plugins/__init__.py` are available to root specs.
- Tutorial docs under `examples/` describe the root workflow, not every standalone package feature.

## Generated or Secondary Areas

- `pipelines/` is an example/manual output area used by explicit compile examples.
- `compiled/` is created on demand by `pipeline submit` and `benchmark submit`.
- `results/` contains result artifacts and examples, not source-of-truth configuration.
- `TimeMixer/` is a separate legacy code drop and is not the maintained entrypoint for `models/timemixer-new`.
